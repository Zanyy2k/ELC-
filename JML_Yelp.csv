Ryan P.,176,21909,1497,1,18,12,12,5,3138,"[<p lang=""en"">Go JO-JO it's your birthday<br/>We gon party like it's your birthday <br/>We gon spray MALONE all up in ya face babe!<br/>And we can still buy by JO when<br/>It's not your birthday!<br/><br/>I'm REALLY SURPRISED I have NOT written a review for this place.<br/><br/>Ok here is the info on JO-JO. \xa0It's from London and you can find it in several places AROUND the world. \xa0It's one of ZZZ-BEST fragrances! \xa0You'll know them by their black and white or ivory clean and simple stores and packaging. \xa0They have colognes things for the home such as candles lotions body mist shampoo conditioner bath wash etc. \xa0A REALLY wide variety of things for everyone if you're into smelling GOOD and NOT like a fonky donkey.<br/><br/>JO-JO is NOT just for women or the home but also for men. \xa0YES MEN! \xa0Who doesn't like a MAN that smells like a piece of heaven? \xa0I LOVE a MAN THAT SMALLS GOOD! \xa0It can ALMOST MAKE your clothes fall off! \xa0GOOD GRACIOUS! \xa0They don't have as many colognes for men but men tend to be pretty simple and either like to smell like NOTHING (just clean) or the wood nature forest or camping type smells. \xa0Almost always something outdoorsy for some reason but they do cater to men as well so you might find something her you the man in your life.<br/><br/>Service is ALWAYS TOP NOTCH and I have NEVER experienced a PUSHY sales person which is WONDERFUL! \xa0If you get it as a gift and don't like the fragrance you can exchange it for store credit or something else. \xa0So that works PREFECTLY for me. \xa0They also do GIFT CARDS which are GREAT if you don't know what to get the person they can pick out what they want. \xa0<br/><br/> You can also shop and have items sent to you from online but if you go in he store you can mix and match your fragrance to find something you like that is different. \xa0This is AWESOME. \xa0Remember the days waayyy back when when cosmetic counters would give out samples? \xa0Well that still holds true here. \xa0WHAT WHAT! \xa0Yes so nice to try before you buy. \xa0<br/><br/>They have fruity floral spicy woody light floral citrus and some that are heavier and intense I think is what they call them. \xa0I LOVE vanilla and Anise but I also LOVE the Intense smells which work well with my body chemistry. \xa0That is what is so great about this place. \xa0When you mix and match you are able to find what will work PREFECTLY with YOUR body chemistry. \xa0There is nothing worse than someone that wears something that doesn't go with their body chemistry. \xa0YIKES! \xa0Talk about machine gun to the nostrils. \xa0Oey-vey!<br/><br/>The prices are pretty reasonable and what you'd find for a nice fragrance in any mall or perfume counter. \xa030ml cost $60.00 and 60ML is $120. \xa0And you REALLY don't need a lot. \xa0So there is no need to be HEAVY HANDED. \xa0No matter the scent the body lotion has a lighter scent and I for one can't really smell it when I wear it or even when my friend wears it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a change than stop by here. \xa0You can also find them in Macy's and Nordstrom but the selection is probably not as vast as in the actual store or on line.</p>]"
Craigers S.,77,2202,875,0,0,0,2,3,394,"[<p lang=""en"">A half hour before closing they were very much intent on end of night tasks rather than helping us. Sales people are hit and miss here. Some very nice at least one snooty one. But I've always enjoyed their very pure fragrances. This was our first visit to this store we tested a few but didn't buy. No samples were offered. I will have to ask next time and see how that goes.</p>]"

The Expert helping me was Gigi and I was vowed by not only her knowledge but most important of all the patience with which she explained every product and took the time for me to experience and savor each one before moving to the next product.<br/><br/>Management Gigi is a keeper and I am a convert to now shopping at your store thanks to her.</p>]"
Elizabeth S.,7,0,13,0,0,0,1,5,550,"[<p lang=""en"">I love coming into the boutique. Dana B. is the absolute best--she is so helpful and knowledgeable and always goes out of her way to find something the customer will love. She goes above and beyond--which is refreshing since many fragrance sales assistants can often be stuck up and unwilling to offer samples or other assistance. Dana is such a doll she's always happy to see her customers and is enthusiastic about Jo Malone--you can tell she personally loves and uses the products herself and she stands behind the product line.</p>]"

Dana G.,83,0,22,0,0,0,0,5,217,"[<p lang=""en"">Jo Malone at South Coast Plaza won the prize when they hired Dana!! She is amazing. My husband bought me cologne at another store but I returned it and rebought it through Dana. She values customers.</p>]"
Sybil L.,32,834,19,0,0,0,0,5,695,"[<p lang=""en"">I believe this is the only Jo Malone boutique that you will find in So Cal that is not just a counter at a retail store such as Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus. I simply love this store and the very nice people who work there. I've been shopping at this boutique for a while and have been attending their events and launches for a few years. It's so much fun! I love all the JM scents and products. Dana is so knowledgeable about everything JM and makes me feel so special when I come in to shop to find out about a new scent or product or to just say hello! Give them a visit and say hello to Dana or Katherine \xa0and if it's your birthday you'll be invited for their hand massage!</p>]"
Megan S.,172,0,2,0,0,1,2,5,841,"[<p lang=""en"">If you are ever craving the royal treatment at South Coast Plaza head into Jo Malone and ask for Dana Beyer! I can't even describe her presence as ""customer service"" simply because once you meet her she becomes a dear friend within 30 seconds. I could literally spend hours in that store and discovering each product is like finding a gem. <br/><br/>I meandered into the store to look for bridesmaids gifts for my upcoming wedding and Dana was quick to help narrow down the perfect gifts. I ended up getting the bridesmaids mothers AND grandmothers a special JM gift with her help and expertise. To top it off (with a sleek black bow) she asked if she could have extra time to wrap each gift so they look extra special! I must say her gift wrapping skills could put Santa Claus to shame! <br/><br/>Thank you so much!</p>]"
Elena Z.,3,19,47,0,0,0,0,5,413,"[<p lang=""en"">Walked in just because I was curious and heard so many great things about this brand of scents. <br/>Gigi was a doll!!!! I picked up two different scents. She was so patient with me as a sampled everything and explained which scents go with other scents. <br/>Her customer service was top notch and because of that will return to purchase more products. <br/>Thank you Gigi. I love my new scents!</p>]"
Julie G.,1,0,21,0,0,1,1,5,1447,"[<p lang=""en"">JM at SCP is AMAZING. Excellent service wonderful product; great packaging charming storefront! Excellence every time!<br/><br/>The Product:<br/>Jo Malone is an amazing product; very classy wonderfully close to natural (as close as you can get without chemicals - I use mostly essential oils for scenting) and Jo Malone has a beautiful natural feel but has the lasting power of a perfume. Because you can layer scents using several different preferences the possibilities are endless. The lotions are amazing as well (and I have a small business where I make my own natural lotions and scrubs!) - creamy luxurious!<br/><br/>The Service:<br/>Dana is my absolute favorite! She has been my Jo Malone Go-To for the past two years and I am so thankful for her kind patient service. For my birthday I have visited JM for the royal birthday treatment for the past three years; two of which Dana hosted me and my best two girlfriends who also love the product. Hand massage; juice in a champagne glass; a little treat; and a chance to try some new scents - it is the perfect mini-vaca for an afternoon. Dana is AMAZING. Thank you for the incredible service!<br/><br/>My favorite scents:<br/>Wild Bluebell (a classic and a must-have!)<br/>Mimosa and Cardamom (layers so naturally with something fruity - like Nectarine or Bluebell)<br/>Earl Grey and Cucumber (a great blend of savory and sweet - refreshing but deep)<br/><br/>JB</p>]"

Cindy D.,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,773,"[<p lang=""en"">There is everything to love in this store--colognes lotions bath oils home scents the stylists specially Dana Beyer! A friend introduced me to Joe Malone last year and that's when I met her. Very helpful patient and generous with her time knowledge and customer service. I particularly admire her helping my children find Christmas presents by phone and having them delivered because one of them was out-of-state. It certainly took some stress off our busy holiday calendar! <br/><br/>A few weeks ago I went with a group of friends and Dana managed to assist us all even our spouses. Everyone left happy and looking forward to the next experience specially now that we're more adventurous in mixing scents! Thanks for letting us play and discover!</p>]"
Paul B.,321,4025,810,1,3,5,5,5,575,"[<p lang=""en"">When I was walking inside the Wynn Esplanade (mini high-end mall) I ran into a store called Jo Malone. The smell from the cologne and candles is what drawn me inside and the name has been stuck in my head and the scents smell so refined. Currently I own the Jo Malone scent ""Roses"" and the smell is so tantalizing!<br/><br/>Jo Malone and Tom Ford are the highest on my list for best smelling cologne along with Yve Chantre but they're not cheap and you can't find Jo Malone in every major department store except for Bloomingdales and other highend malls.</p>]"
Maripet D.,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,871,"[<p lang=""en"">I have been using Jo Malone perfumes for more than 10 years because I love how they smell &amp; the unique fragrance it creates when I layer one perfume over the other. I love going to Jo Malone Boutique at South Coast Plaza not just because of its huge inventory which you don't normally find in other Jo Malone shops but also because of this wonderful lady Dana Beyer who is so professional patient &amp; full of energy in assisting me in choosing the right scent . She is so hardworking &amp; always wears a smile whenever I see her. Because of her excellent customer service .... Dana spends time with me making sure that I am satisfied &amp; happy with the items that I purchased my friends now ask for her to assist them whenever they shop at the South Coast Plaza Jo Malone Boutique. Dana you are Truly A Major Asset to the Jo Malone Company.</p>]"
Lucilla G.,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,1011,"[<p lang=""en"">This store is my happy place!<br/><br/>I was struggling to find a chic and exciting bridesmaid gift to give to my girls at my wedding one I'd appreciate getting. \xa0Once I found out that this was exactly what Kate Middleton gave her maid's I was sold. \xa0I worked with Dana (who is amazing) at the South Coast Plaza boutique to find the perfect scent for each girl and then we had their names engraved on the bottles. \xa0It was extremely personal and elegant. \xa0<br/><br/>Obviously working on a deadline and shipping everything across the country can be stressful but Dana made it seamless on point and was extremely communicative throughout the process. \xa0Everything arrived beautifully packaged on time and ready to go for my East Coast wedding. \xa0<br/><br/>I also got an engraved bottle with my new last name and wedding day scent I still get giddy every time I use it and my husband knows where to go for every birthday holiday and anniversary gift to come. \xa0Great experience here!</p>]"
Ellen C.,63,0,80,0,0,0,0,4,212,"[<p lang=""en"">Wonderful and subtle perfume with crisp citrus overtone and warmer vanilla and amber undertones. I don't know why it's so expensive but I finally sprang for this as a birthday present for myself.</p>]"

Ashlee Y.,202,1,5,0,0,0,0,5,800,"[<p lang=""en"">Felice &amp; Katherine &amp; Julia were absolute DOLLS. I went in to get presents for my bridesmaids and they were all SUPER helpful. I discussed with them everything from my engagement shoot to my wedding in china and they were all just so friendly &amp; we chatted away like old friends. Felice was wonderful with her fragrance suggestions and I was absolutely in love with the items I picked out. I got Mimosa Cologne &amp; Peony Suede Creme for my bridesmaids &amp; Bluebell+Peony Cologne for myself to mix together! All with the help of the lovely Felice &amp; Julia! Apparently Peony Suede's huge for weddings ;) They packaged them all beautifully as wellFelice even gave me a sample goodie bag!

Elizabeth A.,499,6,278,1,1,0,5,5,2065,"[<p lang=""en"">Ok..they've somehow managed to top themselves. My mom and I came here for the 15% birthday month deal since it was my mom's birthday this month. This visit I took the time to smell the scents (I pretty much just smelled the rose one last year and went with that) and each scent is so interesting and different- it depends on the person but you will find some amazing and you will find some not so pleasing. What's great is how fresh and authentic they smell. It seriously makes other perfumes that I own artificial smelling in contrast. I almost don't even want to bother with other perfume brands now. <br/><br/>This trip I purchased the pear perfume and lotion. Omg the lotion is just as amazing as the perfume- it feels like silk and the scent is long lasting and not harsh on my sensitive skin. The pear perfume reminds me of something..I can't place it..an alcoholic drink maybe? But it just smells sooooo good. You can even combine scents like the rose and pear. <br/><br/>Randomly I was reading a magazine in the waiting room of an appointment earlier that day when I saw an article on perfumes and they showed a picture of a Jo Malone perfume box set which consisted of 5 different perfumes..this magazine was from Dec but I thought I would ask anyway and see if they had any left...they did! Got 2 of the last few sets. <br/><br/>I also want to commemorate Brianna on her excellent attention to customers. She was the only one working at the time and give special attention to each customer in the store. My mom was in a wheelchair and she offered to ship our purchases to our house so we wouldn't have to carry them around..it's REALLY difficult to push around a wheelchair with huge shopping bags. Brianna was super friendly and helped us pick out products without being pushy. She even gave us a ton of samples. <br/><br/>I would love to try out the candles or bath products next time...trying not to make my wallet cry this month. <br/><br/>I also LOVE the packaging of the products..It just looks so classy. Perfect for gifts.</p>]"

Rica M.,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,5,820,"[<p lang=""en"">I love Jo Malone! It is one of my favorite stores in South Coast Plaza. I always look forward to their private events when there is a seasonal scent or new fragrance. I love having my birthday hand massage there too. Dana is one of the stylists there and she is just awesome! She is friendly knowledgeable thoughtful and I just love her. I don't live in the OC and I will only buy Jo Malone products from the South Coast Plaza store and preferably from Dana. I call her up and let her know about what I need/want and she is always so helpful. Once I ordered a gift and I could have waited for the overnight delivery but instead she sent the items to me by courier. Wow! That's just customer service that is above and beyond!

I love their wide range of perfumes and love their layering concept to make the perfume your own. Their packaging is also so cute and presentable for gifts. A lot of their scents go so well together. They are always coming out with new scents so I love stopping by this store to check it out. I will however always be loyal to the scent that started my relationship with Jo Malone - Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey. This store's employees are always super helpful (they introduce me to different scents to layer and provide samples) and are never pushy with selling.</p>]"

Ask for some of the ones you are interested in so you can try them on your skin to see what the scent is like after it initially dries down.<br/>Does it give you a headache? Do you like the notes you are smelling throughout the day? Does it blend well with your skin?<br/>If it doesn't keep looking.<br/><br/>I appreciate them letting me use the take home samples so I can make a better decision about what I purchase--often times if I like the scent I'll buy the biggest size.</p>]"
Jimmy N.,601,167,801,1,8,1,3,5,1939,"[<p lang=""en"">Have you ever seen Love Actually? If you haven't then you need to see it it's one great film. Anyway if you have then you'll know what I'm talking about and you'll know why you need to shop here for your fragrances or gifts. :D<br/><br/>Remember that one scene where Rowan Atkinson (mr bean!!!)'s character goes into the department store to buy his wife a gift but it wasn't really for his wife or something (i don't recall the scene too clearly but this next part I remember for sure).. he gets something like a candle that's nice and he asks for gift wrap? Okay so Jo Malone does the exact same thing with their gifts (should you ask for gift wrap!) <br/><br/>I bought a set of 3 2oz. candles in a citrusy floral scent as a gift and the gal was so wonderful to help me choose since it's always hard to shop scents for other people. She wrapped it up pretty much exactly like that scene in Love Actually! She put the candle set (already boxed) inside a larger box (lined with some clear cellophane) filled the box with a variety of complimenting potpourri sifted in some rose petals and other flower petals.. tossed in some dried fruit slices (all complimenting scents to the purchased item too) put the lid on the box and tied a gorgeous black ribbon bow on it. This process took about 10-15 minutes FYI.. lol. <br/><br/>They have an amazing selection of scents &amp; fragrances from woodsy to floral and everything in between. they can even custom make a scent for you too if you want (at a ""nominal"" custom fee). sure they're a little more priced than say Yankee Candle that's sold in your local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores but you really do get what you pay for. Their candles last for a bazillion hours and so do their perfumes. :) <br/><br/>I have no specific salesperson to go to they're all really helpful in my opinion so have at it and good luck choosing a scent for you (or someone else!)</p>]"

You know how sales people are like.. She told me that I should spray some on walk around and take some time to decide. I was debating whether to get coco chanel mademoiselle or jo malone peony and suede. Not getting too much into reviewing the perfume but jo malone scent stayed the same note throughout the 2 hours as I walked around the mall. Jo malone colognes can be layered on which I thought was a weird concept. Their scents are amazing and have many selections. I like floral scents and they smell so good and pretty. They wrapped up the perfume like it was a gift. The process took a while but they had technical issues and their system was down. Totally understand when that happens. It sucks when everything is down but she did her best and gave such excellent customer service. She also gave me two samples that I can layer the cologne with. Two thumbs up!!</p>]"

I bought that same cologne that year and I have loved all of Jo Malones scents ever since. <br/><br/>They are clean crisp and fresh. Made of surprisingly refreshing scents such as Grapefruit Orange Blossom Amber &amp; Lavender and Nutmeg Ginger. Her bottles run 100 bucks for a 3.4 ounce and are designed to be layered. <br/><br/>I layer the Vetyver with Amber and Lavender for a masculine clean scent. Her scents truly are remarkable and have a ""You will notice me ! "" effect. <br/><br/>Jo Malone started off as a facialist in London and then mixed her own scents and now sells both scents and skin care. Her Frothy mint cleanser is highly recommended. A little goes a long way and the bottle will last you forever. Seriously its the best cleanser I have ever used! The sales staff is friendly and will over load you with samples with your purchase. <br/><br/>Boutique fragrances like Jo Malone Santa Maria Novella Bond 9 Eau de Italie L'Artisan separate the classy from the common every day scents you find at macys. <br/><br/>Buy a bottle you wont be disappointed!</p>]"
Diane L.,9,8,32,0,0,0,1,5,1400,"[<p lang=""en"">I had what I would consider to be a perfect and flawless shopping experience at the Jo Malone Boutique in South Coast Plaza. I was greeted and helped by Elizabeth the Manager I was amazed at how friendly and helpful she was. The best part was you could tell she had total faith and love for the product she sells.<br/><br/>I originally came in just to purchase the new Wild Bluebell fragrance Elizabeth helped me put together great combinations that included Jo Malone scents I already owned as well as ones I had yet to purchase. I love how she didn't force or pressure me into purchasing anything she wanted me to love it and not just like it. Of course I ended up leaving with 3 new scents instead of just the 1. She introduced me to the Jo Malone Oils which I had yet to try because the idea of rubbing oil on my body seemed a little odd to me but after trying them in the store I knew I would be coming back to purchase a few oils later this month. I left with my purchases some samples and a list of items I would be getting next time.<br/><br/>Overall I loved my experience and left feeling like I had made a smart purchase and was glad I took the time to go to the SCP Boutique and not just purchase from one of the department stores where the sales people tend to now be as knowledgeable about the products. If you visit ask for Elizabeth you won't be disappointed!</p>]"

She had the Assam &amp; Grapefruit scent -- Amazing!<br/><br/>I entered and browsed a little. I am not sure who helped me but she might have been new.. Anyways she told me that this scent was sold out \xa0but then we found some and they only had a handful left. She said that this was a limited edition fragrance and that if they relaunch it it will be in the next 3 to 4 years and not sooner. I couldn't tell if she was being honest or trying to sell more. Yet to be on the safe side \xa0I bought a couple to stock up. <br/><br/>I also purchased a body creme and perhaps one of the most expensive body cremes I have purchased in my life -- better be worth it!<br/>I will get the name and post it later.<br/><br/>Well it seems she was telling the truth I can't find that scent on the website. Good!<br/><br/>Also they beautifully pack each and every product you purchase and give fragrance samples of what they think will go well with what you have purchased.</p>]"

The free standing store on the second floor of South Coast Plaza was not a pleasant experience.

Zizi B.,993,30,239,0,4,3,6,5,668,"[<p lang=""en"">I love this place. Not so much the store as the product. The store is nice and the salespeople always seem to be friendly and helpful. Jo Malone makes very nicely scented perfumes body lotions soaps candles etc. <br/><br/>My first favorite was the Orange Blossom now I adore the Red Roses. It smells just like Persian rose water not rose perfume. I never recommend giving someone perfume for a gift unless you specifically know what they want or like since it's so personal and everyone's tastes are different... but a gift from this store would be excellent. Once again I like the Orange Blossom and the Red Roses most and my address is...</p>]"
